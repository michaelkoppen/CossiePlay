    <li>It is a performance art in which the participants called cosplayers wear costumes and fashion accessories to represent a specific character.</li>
    <li>Cosplayers often interact to create a subculture.</li>
    <li>The term “cosplay” applies to any costumed role-playing in venues apart from the stage.</li>
    <li>Any entity that lends itself to dramatic interpretation may be taken up as a subject and it is not unusual to see genders switched.</li>
    <li>Favourite sources include mange and anime, comic books and cartoons, videogames, and live-action films and television series</li>
    <li>The rapid growth in the number of people cosplaying as a hobby since 1990 has made the phenomenon a significant aspect of popular culture in Japan and some other parts of Asia and in the Western World.</li>
